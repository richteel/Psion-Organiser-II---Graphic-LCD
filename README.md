There is not much here for this project and it has been a while since I worked on the project. I don't know when I will get back to it. I did see a really cool project today along these same lines using an OLED display. The project is on YouTube by user <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNweFQHar6-JMdXFk-MrOtQ/videos">A Menadue</a>.

I may abandon this project and try to do what A Menadue is doing as he has been able to do a great deal more work on this and in my opinion done a far better job that I would. I have been debating on attempting to recreate what Psion did or doing something different to take advantage of additional I/O and the graphics display.

The first video of A Menadue's project is at <a href="https://youtu.be/v2YWStDrQIs">https://youtu.be/v2YWStDrQIs</a>.

The display that I've used is a Crystalfontz LCD <a href="https://www.crystalfontz.com/product/cfag12232dyyhva-transflective-graphic-lcd-122x32">CFAG12232D-YYH-VA</a>. I also used an Arduino Micro for the microcontroller to run the code. I was planning on using a Raspberry Pi Zero W but with Raspberry Pi Pico/RP2040 and an ESP32 seem link a better option.

Here are some photos taken of the sample code running the display.
